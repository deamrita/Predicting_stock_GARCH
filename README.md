Predicting the volatility of Tesla stock price using GARCH

The generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is a method for predicting financial market volatility. GARCH models explain financial markets in which volatility swings, becoming more volatile during financial crises or global catastrophes and becoming less volatile during periods of relative tranquility and stable economic growth.

In this Python code we have tried to predict the volatility of stock price of Tesla for the next 7 days with the help of GARCH model.

P.S: This is merely an attempt to forecast stock prices using time series analysis algorithms; it should not be applied to put real-world bets.
